    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to
    Learn in 2022</h1>

    <p>There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. <span>The U.S. Bureau of <br>
    Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is <br>
    more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a <br>
    software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. <br>
    workers.</p>

    <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of <br>
    software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often <br>
    beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming <br>
    can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming <br>
    experience.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://itb.ac.id/program-studi-magister-sains-komputasi" target="blank">Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</a> at 
        Northeastern University is <br>
    specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another <br>
    field of study.</p>

    <p><i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come <br>
    out as software engineers,”</i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer <br>
    science programs at Northeastern University-Seattle. <i>“We focus on math, programming, and <br>
    a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</i></p>

    <p>Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know <br>
    which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages <br>
    of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average <br>
    annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.</p>
